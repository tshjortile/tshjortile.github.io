title: Git - Notes and Tutorial Screenshot

The next assignment was the completion of codeacademy's git tutorial.

Things I will often need and that are important to know:

```git

git clone <path>
With this function one can import a git repository to one's computer.

git add .
This adds all the new document on this level of the directory. If there is more than one folder with stuff to add, go one level up.

git commit -m "<description>"
This commits the changes to the branch. It's important to be precise in the description. Maybe avoid swear words.

git status
Status report. Quite useful to see what's commited.

git push
push this to the branch you're working on. It synchs, then a pull request can be sent.

git pull
Pull new data from the master branch.

```


Here's the confirmation screenshot of the online tutorial:
