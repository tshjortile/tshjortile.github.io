The next assignment was broken down into two parts, because it took a bit longer to accomplish and included several tasks.
1) Extract geographical data from the Richmond 'Dispatch'.
2) Match the regularized forms of placenames to latitude and longitude from another file (open access downloaded data), so it can be imported to QGIS.
3) Import the data to QGIS.


# *1) Extract geographical data from the Richmond 'Dispatch'*



# *2) It's a match?*


# *3) Import data to QGIS*


# *Things I learned doing this assignment (besides the obvious):*
--> it's way more practical to compartmentalize: Break the task down to smaller bits instead of looking at it as one big mess.
--> a little bit of human-machine-interaction is always necessary and needed in order to complete the task at hand (a.k.a.: Always look at the outcome file)
--> testing the program every step of the way is very, very helpful (later on these tests can be commented out anyway)
